# Future improvements

These are mostly in order, meaning items at the top will probably be implemented sooner than items at the bottom of the list

- Refactor counting code to support dedicated displays per category
- Support ammo for counting and auto-craft (auto-sort already does support it)
- Improve end user documentation
- Add documentation for possible contributors (until then, just make a fork and PR please)
